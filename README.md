# Pokedex

## About the project
The Pokedex project is a command-line application designed to retrieve and display information about Pokémon. It leverages the PokeAPI to fetch data about Pokémon based on their ID. This project is an exercise in implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, specifically the SOLID principles, in a Java-based application.

### Pattern
We use MOdel-view-controller (MVC) as design pattern.
